# Go Enums

This repo contains the source files for the repl.it project located here: https://repl.it/@JimLynch/Go-Enums

## Why?
The purpose of this project is to give an example of how the Go "type struct" syntax allows you define, initialize, and reference properties of your data in a succinctly explicit manner.
